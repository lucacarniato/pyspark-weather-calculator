# Weather calculator

The Python package weathercalculator solves Go Data Driven challenge of calculating the heat waves in the Netherlands,
as defined by KNMI. An heat wave is defined as follow:

"The KNMI defines a heat wave as a period of at least 5 consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds 25 째C.
Additionally, during this 5 day period, the maximum temperature in De Bilt should exceed 30 째C for at least 3 days."

The application gives the following results:

Heat waves

| From date   | To date (inc.) | Duration (in days) | Number of tropical days | Max temperature |
| ------------| -------------  | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------- |

As bonus point, the cold waves were also caomputed.Cold waves are defined as follow:

"A cold wave is a period of excessively cold weather with a minimum of five consecutive days below 
freezing (max temperature below 0.0 째C) and at least three days with high frost (min temperature is lower than -10.0 째C)."

Cold waves

| From date   | To date (inc.) | Duration (in days) | Number of high frost days | Min temperature |
| ------------| -------------  | ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------- |

To execute the application with cached data use the following command

To execute the application with raw data use the following command

To run the application in docker use the following command

## Application design

The application is organized as follow:
+ data:
    + raw_data directory to store downloaded data
    + cache directory to store the results of the transformations.
These results might be reused when a client application requests to calculate the heat waves within a period where the maximum
and minimum daily temperature where already calculated.
+ scripts: contains the Jupyter notebook used in the application prototyping phase
+ tests:
    + data: contains the data used by the unit tests
    + unit: contains some  tests to verify the correctness of the parsing functions (tokenizers) and heat/cold waves calculators
+ weathercalculator: contains the Python package. Most of the code is implemented as self standing functions, 
to facilitate a future implementation of an AirFlow ETL job.
    + Extractors.py: can contain the functions used for downloading KNMI data into data/raw_data.
    + Transformers.py: contains the functions used to process and transform the data contained in data/raw_data. 
    This file contains the PySpark queries used for computing the maximum and minimum daily temperatures from the 10 minutes raw data 
    measurements (20Gb of text data).The result of daily_min_max is a reduced pandas dataframe of 150KB. 
    + Calculators.py: contains the functions used for calculating the heat and cold waves from the reduced dataframe.

The directory structure facilitates extending the applications with additional Transformers or Calculators.

# Future work

+ Implement data extractors in weathercalculator/Extractors.py for downloading KNMI data into data/raw_data 
+ Implement an Apache Airflow ETL job by using the functions in Extractors/Transformers/Calculators
+ Implement Cache invalidation mechanism
+ Implement a REST for the application (e.g. using Flask)
