# Weather calculator

The Python package weathercalculator solves Go Data Driven challenge of calculating the heat waves in the Netherlands,
as defined by KNMI. An heat wave is defined as follow:

"The KNMI defines a heat wave as a period of at least 5 consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds 25 째C.
Additionally, during this 5 day period, the maximum temperature in De Bilt should exceed 30 째C for at least 3 days."

The application gives the following results:

Heat waves

| From date   | To date (inc.) | Duration (in days) | Number of tropical days | Max temperature |
| ------------| -------------  | ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------- |

As bonus point, the cold waves were also caomputed.Cold waves are defined as follow:

"A cold wave is a period of excessively cold weather with a minimum of five consecutive days below 
freezing (max temperature below 0.0 째C) and at least three days with high frost (min temperature is lower than -10.0 째C)."

Cold waves

| From date   | To date (inc.) | Duration (in days) | Number of high frost days | Min temperature |
| ------------| -------------  | ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------- |

## Application design

The application is organized as follow:
dir structure with what things do

The application is implemented as a Python package.
